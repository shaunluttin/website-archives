<h1>Why is My Internet Slow?</h1>

    <p>A client / friend recently has been asking me why his Internet is slow. I have told him that it isn't slow but his computer is. This is his current setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>RAM, 704 MB, this is five to six times less than the amount in most modern computers.</li>
<li>CPU, 1.40 GHz dual core, this appears to rate limit media rich operations (e.g. YouTube).</li>
<li>HDD, 150 GMB, should be more than sufficient in size; we didn't check its speed, though.</li>
<li>Internet speed, 12.00 Mbps download speed, this is fine for most operations.</li>
<li>OS, Windows XP, this could run into problems because MS is ending support for XP very soon.</li>
<li>Malware, there are no apparent viruses or other malware</li>
</ul>

<p>I concluded that the rate limiters are hardware not software based and are probably related to the CPU speed and are definitely related to the small amount of RAM. My recommendation was to maybe increase the RAM and definitely to start saving for a new computer. My friend, though, seems convinced that his Internet speed is the rate limiter.</p>

<p>The crux of the questions is, "What is the current rate limiter of his Internet browsing experience?" Bottlenecks are very hard to nail down for sure, because there are several variables at play. <br /><br />1. Internet speed. <br />2. Router signal strength. <br />3. Computer processor speed. <br />4. RAM size. <br />5. Hard disk speed. <br />6. The current processing load on the system. <br /><br />To prove that one of these is the rate limiter, we would have to demonstrate cause and effect. That means 1. showing correlation, 2. demonstrating temporal precedence, and 3. ruling out alternative hypothesis. The last one is the hardest when we have 6 variables.<br /><br />I think that it's both possible and unlikely that my friend's Internet speed is the rate limiter. When he moved his computer closer to his wireless router, his experience of surfing the web improved, which does demonstrate both correlation and temporal precedence. That said, an alternative hypothesis is that the current processing load on the system happened to go down at the same time, thereby improving the experience of surfing the web, because the computer had more resources to spare at the time. For instance, maybe when his web experience was slow, his computer was downloading and installing some important updates, or was busy backing itself up, or was indexing for search. Sure, it was also further away from the router but this wasn't slowing down thing. Then, when moving the computer closer to the router, the updates (or whatever) were complete, freeing up the processor to give a speedy experience of using the Internet. To determine whether it was router signal strength or current processing load, we would have to keep the processing load on the system constant while moving the computer further and closer from the router and while keeping other variables constant. So, we haven't figure out cause and effect through that experiment. <br /><br />Based on theory, it's unlikely that his Internet speed is the rate limiter because his Internet speed is quite good (12 Mbps) if not above average for modern computers. At this speed, he should only experience a lag when doing stuff like downloading large documents or videos. Also, when I was last at his house, he was receiving three bars out of four on his Wi-Fi strength, and the Shaw speed test showed 12 Mbps download. Having that many mega bytes per second is good; three bars is a strong signal. Right now, for instance, my router signal is at three bars (same as his) and my Shaw Speed Test shows a download speed of 24 Mbps (twice his). For activities such as checking email and browsing text or images on the Internet, 12 or more Mbps is sufficient. Having over 20 Mbps is only necessary for more intensive activities like streaming movies and publishing large websites. So, if he is experiencing slow Internet while checking his email, this is a sign of a bogged down computer not a slow Internet connection. In contrast to his average to above average Internet speed, he has a tiny amount of RAM (760 MB). That is really tiny. <br /><br />He also mentioned that Internet Explorer is slower than Firefox is for him. This also supports the idea that it is his computer's RAM and/or processing speed which is the rate limiter. Old versions of Internet Explorer are hogs for computer resources. They are large computer programs that use up more RAM and computer processor capacity that do other browsers. As a result, the experience of browsing the Internet with old versions of Internet Explorer is often slower than it is using Firefox.<br /><br />I like to use a kitchen analogy to explain the possible bottlenecks. All the action happens in the kitchen in which:</p>

<ul>
<li>The chef is the computer processor, and we want it to be fast.</li>
<li>The kitchen is the RAM, and we want it to be large.</li>
<li>The appliance storage is the hard disk drive; we want to be able to move appliances quickly from storage to the kitchen.</li>
<li>The grocery store is the Internet; we also want to deliver ingredients quickly from the grocery store to the kitchen.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, my client had a slower experience of the Internet with an old version of Internet Explorer. Using an old version of Internet explorer is like cooking lasagna from scratch. It's an intensive project. You need to bring many appliances from storage into the kitchen where the chef can use them to prepare the ingredients. If your appliance storage is far away this will limit the rate of cooking; if your kitchen is small it will become crowded will appliances and ingredients; if your your chef is slow it will take time to read the cook book and prepare each dish. If all those are non-ideal, then it matters little how fast you can deliver more ingredients from the grocery store to the kitchen. The chef is in the kitchen trying to deal with existing ingredients while more carloads of ingredients shows up at the door! Overload. The rate limiter is not a lack of ingredients from the grocery store (not the Internet speed). Indeed, too many ingredients aggravates the problem because the chef now has to stack them somewhere.<br /><br />For my client, increasing the speed of the Internet would be like increasing the speed at which groceries arrive from the grocery store. On the other hand, using Firefox instead of Internet Explore is more like cooking a peanut butter and jam sandwich. Things are faster because the project is less intensive.<br /><br />A 12 Mbps internet speed is good rate of grocery delivery. The 760 MB of RAM my client has is an extremely tiny kitchen. Also, his processor is a pretty slow moving chef. Result: internet content is probably piling up at his door while the processor madly tries to deal with it.<br /><br />Why did my client's experience of the web did improve as he moved his computer closer to his router? One alternative is that it improved as Internet content delivery increased. That is, maybe his speedy chef was always waiting around in the large kitchen for more groceries to arrive. Once they started to come faster, things picked up considerably. Another alternative, though, is that extra demand on my clients processor and RAM temporarily decreased, allowing it to focus more on processing incoming Internet content. Maybe his average-Joe chef was able to focus more on cooking!<br /><br />What do you think?</p>
